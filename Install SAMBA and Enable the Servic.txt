Install SAMBA and Enable the Service
1- Install Samba and its tools:
sudo dnf install samba samba-client samba-common -y

2- Enable the services:
sudo systemctl enable --now smb nmb

Create Shared Folder, Create Users and Groups, and Assign the Necessary Permissions to the Shared Folder
3- Create a directory to share:
sudo mkdir /srv/samba/
GRANT PERMISSIONS SO THAT ALL USERS CAN READ, WRITE, AND EXECUTE:
sudo chmod 777 /srv/samba

In the Samba folder, create 100 files named adrian (adrian1, adrian2 … adrian100)
Change to the Samba folder created for sharing resources:
cd /srv/samba/

Create the 100 files:
sudo touch adrian{1..100}.txt

4- CONFIGURE THE SAMBA CONFIGURATION FILE
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf

ADD THE FOLLOWING PARAMETERS:
[global]
workgroup = WORKGROUP
server string = Samba Server %v
netbios name = rocky
security = user
map to guest = Bad User
dns proxy = no

[Public]
path = /srv/samba/repositorio
browsable = yes
writable = yes
guest ok = yes
read only = no

NOTE:
[global]: Global options for Samba.
workgroup = WORKGROUP: The name of the workgroup, compatible with Windows.
security = user: Requires user-based authentication.
map to guest = Bad User: Unknown users are mapped as guests.
[Public]: Definition of the shared resource.
path: Path to the shared directory.
browsable: Allows it to be visible on the network.
writable: Allows writing to the share.
guest ok: Permits access without a password.
read only = no: Disables read-only mode.

5- Configure firewalld to allow Samba:
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=samba
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

6- CREATE A SAMBA USER AND GROUP (OPTIONAL)
sudo useradd argenis-samba
sudo smbpasswd -a argenis-samba
sudo usermod -aG grupo-samba argenis-samba

Explanation:
useradd sambauser: Creates a local user.
smbpasswd -a sambauser: Adds the user to the Samba database and prompts to set a password.

Important: Because in this example we configured the share for guest access (guest ok = yes), creating a user is optional.

7- SET SELinux TO PERMISSIVE MODE:
setenforce 0

Access from a Linux Client
From a Linux client:
smbclient //192.168.1.100/Public -N
//192.168.1.100/Public: Path to the Samba share.
-N: Do not prompt for a password (guest mode).

Or mount the share:
sudo mount -t cifs //192.168.1.100/Public /mnt -o guest

ACCESS FROM A WINDOWS CLIENT
From Windows:
Steps to map a new network drive:
Open File Explorer.
Click on “This PC” in the left panel.
In the top ribbon, select “Map network drive.”
Choose a drive letter (for example, Z:).
In the “Folder” field, enter:
\\IP-Of-the-Server\Public

Check “Reconnect at sign-in” if you want the share to mount automatically at each reboot.

Click “Finish.”

Now, the shared resource will appear as a network drive under “This PC.”
